        <h1>High blood pressure exercise</h1>
        Exercise can be an effective way to manage high blood pressure. Here are
        some exercises that may help:
        <h2>Aerobic exercise:</h2>
        Activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing can
        help lower blood pressure. These exercises improve heart and lung
        function, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy blood flow.
        <h2>Strength training:</h2>
        Strength training exercises such as weight lifting, bodyweight
        exercises, or resistance band exercises can help reduce blood pressure.
        These exercises strengthen the muscles around blood vessels, making them
        more efficient at transporting blood.
        <h2>Yoga:</h2>
        Yoga is a mind-body practice that can help lower blood pressure by
        reducing stress and anxiety. It combines physical postures, breathing
        techniques, and meditation to help calm the mind and body.
        <h2>Tai Chi:</h2>
        Tai Chi is a gentle form of exercise that involves slow, flowing
        movements and deep breathing. It has been shown to help reduce blood
        pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health.
        <h2>Interval training:</h2>
        Interval training involves alternating between short bursts of
        high-intensity exercise and periods of rest or low-intensity exercise.
        This type of exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular health
        and reduce blood pressure. Remember to start slowly and gradually
        increase the intensity and duration of your exercises. If you have high
        blood pressure or any other health concerns, consult with your doctor
        before starting any exercise program. It is also important to maintain a
        healthy and balanced diet and reduce stress to support your
        cardiovascular health.
