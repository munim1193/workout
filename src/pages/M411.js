        <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
        Regular exercise can help to reduce the risk of several types of cancer.
        Here are some exercises that can help:
        <h2>Aerobic exercise:</h2>
        Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling,
        swimming, or dancing, can help to reduce the risk of colon, breast, and
        endometrial cancer. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
        aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise,
        per week.
        <h2>Strength training:</h2>
        Resistance training, such as weight lifting, can help to build and
        maintain muscle mass, which is important for overall health and
        well-being. It may also help to reduce the risk of colon and breast
        cancer. Aim for two to three strength-training sessions per week.
        <h2>High-intensity interval training (HIIT):</h2>
        HIIT is a type of exercise that involves short bursts of intense
        activity followed by periods of rest or lower-intensity activity. HIIT
        may help to reduce the risk of breast, colon, and lung cancer. Examples
        of HIIT workouts include sprint intervals, cycling intervals, or
        bodyweight circuits.
        <h2>Mind-body exercises:</h2>
        Mind-body exercises, such as yoga and tai chi, can help to reduce stress
        and improve overall well-being. These exercises may also help to reduce
        the risk of breast and prostate cancer. 
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>
        Remember, before starting any
        exercise program, it's important to consult with a healthcare
        professional to determine what type and amount of exercise is safe and
        appropriate for you, especially if you have any medical conditions.
        Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding tobacco and excessive
        alcohol consumption, and practicing safe sun exposure can also help to
        reduce the risk of cancer. Regenerate response</p>
