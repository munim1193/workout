        <h1>Exercise for prevention from asthma</h1>
        While exercise can trigger asthma symptoms in some people, regular
        exercise can actually help to improve lung function and reduce the risk
        of asthma attacks in others. Here are some exercises that can help:
        <h2>Low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise:</h2>
        Low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling,
        or swimming, can help to improve lung function and overall fitness.
        These exercises can also help to reduce the risk of obesity, which is a
        risk factor for asthma. Start slowly and gradually increase the
        intensity and duration of your workouts.
        <h2>Warm-up and cool-down:</h2>
        It's important to warm up before exercise to prepare your lungs and
        reduce the risk of asthma symptoms. A good warm-up might include
        stretching, walking, or low-intensity cycling for five to 10 minutes.
        After exercise, take time to cool down gradually by walking or
        stretching.
        <h2>Breathing exercises:</h2>
        Breathing exercises, such as pursed-lip breathing or diaphragmatic
        breathing, can help to improve breathing patterns and reduce the risk of
        asthma symptoms during exercise. These exercises involve taking slow,
        deep breaths and exhaling slowly.
        <h2>Avoid triggers:</h2>
        If exercise triggers your asthma symptoms, try to avoid exercising in
        cold, dry air or in areas with high levels of pollution. It may also be
        helpful to use a bronchodilator medication before exercise to open up
        the airways and reduce the risk of symptoms.
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        Remember, before starting any exercise program, it's important to
        consult with a healthcare professional to determine what type and amount
        of exercise is safe and appropriate for you, especially if you have
        asthma.
