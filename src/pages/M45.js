        <h1>Exercises </h1>
        <h2>1. Walking</h2> 
        Walking is a low-impact activity that many people enjoy.
        Getting your steps can improve your blood pressure, glucose, and
        cholesterol levels. And 30 minutes of brisk walking –– or about 100
        steps a minute –– is a great way to meet the ADA's recommendation for
        daily aerobic exercise. You can also boost the intensity of your walks
        by adding activities like stair climbing. But if you weren't active
        before your diabetes diagnosis, consider starting slowly and gradually
        upping the pace. 
        <h2>2. Running</h2> 
        With proper training –– and your healthcare
        provider's approval –– you can work your way up from brisk walking to
        running. This faster-paced activity has been linked to a reduced risk of
        high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol. 
        <h2>3. Cycling</h2>
        There's a reason stationary bikes have become so popular. Regular
        bicycling can improve everything from your heart and lung health to your
        balance and posture. But you don't need an expensive fitness bike to get
        started. You can grab an old bike and hit the outdoors or try a
        stationary bike at your local gym. And research shows that cycling can
        improve health outcomes for people who have diabetes. 
        <h2>4. Water aerobics</h2>
        There are plenty of reasons to take your workout to the pool. Water exercises like swimming
        are easy on the joints and may reduce blood sugar levels. They may also
        boost overall fitness, strength, and heart health in people with T2D. 
        5.High intensity interval training 
        With HIIT, you switch between short bouts of high-intensity activities and longer bouts of lower-intensity
        moves. You can add it to various exercises like running and cycling. If
        you have Type 2 diabetes, HIIT may decrease your fasting blood sugar. 
        <h2>6.Weight training </h2>
        This form of strength training uses weights or other
        equipment to build or maintain muscle mass and strength. And it may
        increase insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in people with T2D.
        <h2>7. Yoga</h2> 
        Yoga involves low-impact movement, meditation, and breathing. It
        can improve balance, flexibility, and strength. This is especially
        helpful for older people with T2D who might be at greater risk of
        falling. The practice may also help you manage your blood sugar and
        cholesterol levels. 
        <h2>8. Tai chi</h2> 
        Tai chi also combines low-impact moves,
        meditation, and breathing techniques. The ancient practice promotes
        better balance, range of motion, and overall well-being. And adding it
        to your fitness routine may lower your blood sugar. 
        <h2>9. Pilates</h2> 
        Another low-impact form of exercise, Pilates earns a spot on this list for good
        reason. It uses repetitive movements and breath control to strengthen
        your core and improve your balance and posture. And a study showed that
        practicing Pilates helped participants with T2D control their blood
        glucose.
